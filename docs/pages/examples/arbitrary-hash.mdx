## Signing an Arbitrary Hash

Below is a **working example** of how to **request** and **retrieve** a signature for an arbitrary 32-byte hash from the **ChainSignatures** contract **deployed on Sepolia**.

> **Assumption**:
>
> - The ChainSignatures contract is deployed at `0x69C6b28Fdc74618817fa380De29a653060e14009` (example).
> - You have a web3 provider (e.g., viem) pointing to Sepolia.

### Prepare Your Ethers Contract Instance

```ts twoslash filename="init-contract.ts"
import { contracts, constants } from 'signet.js'
// [!include ~/snippets/code/evm/env.ts]

const evmChainSigContract = new contracts.evm.ChainSignatureContract({
  publicClient,
  walletClient,
  contractAddress: constants.CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.ETHEREUM
    .TESTNET_DEV as `0x${string}`,
})
```

### Request a Signature on an Arbitrary Hash

```ts twoslash filename="request-signature.ts"
// [!include init-contract.ts]
// ---cut---

// Suppose you have a 32-byte hash you'd like to have signed:
const hashToSign = Array.from(new Uint8Array(32).fill(1)) // Must be exactly 32 bytes

// Derive the path you want (could be any string)
const path = 'myArbitraryPath'

// Key version (check chainSignatures.latestKeyVersion() if needed)
const keyVersion = 0

const signature = await evmChainSigContract.sign({
  path,
  key_version: keyVersion,
  payload: hashToSign,
})
```

- At this point, the mpc network sees the `SignatureRequested` event, does the off-chain ECDSA signing, and calls `respond(...)`.

### Retrieve the Signature Once Responded

The MPC network will call:

```solidity
chainSignatures.respond(
  requestId,
  SignatureResponse({
    bigR: AffinePoint({ x: rPointX, y: rPointY }),
    s: sValue,
    recoveryId: vValue
  })
);
```

After that transaction is confirmed, a `SignatureResponded` event is emitted. The `sign` methods will handle the event polling internally and return the signature components to you:

```ts twoslash filename="retrieve-signature.ts"
// [!include request-signature.ts]
// ---cut---
console.log('r:', signature.r)
console.log('s:', signature.s)
console.log('v:', signature.v)
```

You now have the ECDSA components (`r`, `s`, `v`) to do whatever you need with them. The deposit is refunded automatically to `msg.sender` of the original `sign` call if there's any excess.
