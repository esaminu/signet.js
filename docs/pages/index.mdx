## Introduction

Managing multiple accounts across different blockchains is a headache. Every chain has its own wallets, private keys, and authentication systems, making cross-chain interactions complex and fragmented. But what if a single abstract account could seamlessly control multiple accounts across different chains—without compromising security? That's now possible through Chain Signatures.

### What Are Chain Signatures?

Chain Signatures are programmable digital signatures that enable cross-chain control, allowing one account on one blockchain to securely manage accounts and assets on entirely different chains.
The system:

- **Derives keys** from a single base key.
- Allows third parties (e.g., dApps, wallets, or protocols) to **request signatures** on-chain.
- Introduces **flexible usage controls**, such as daily spending limits or rate limits, by combining these keys with custom on-chain logic.

### Benefits & Use Cases:

- **One Identity, Many Chains**: Instead of juggling multiple wallets, a single signature from your Ethereum account could authorize actions on any other supported EVM or non-EVM chain, without needing to manage separate private keys.
- **Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions**: Move assets or execute smart contract functions across different chains, without relying on third-party bridges or centralized custodians.
- **Usage Controls**: rate or time-based restrictions can be enforced by the on-chain contract that manages key usage (e.g., "this key can only send up to 1 ETH per day").
- **Recovery or Fallback Conditions**: Instead of storing private keys in a single hardware device, you can use a multi-party computation (MPC) setup that offers user-friendly ways to recover accounts.
- **Signs the Arbitrary State of a Foreign Chain**: Gives your smart contract awareness of whether a transaction it signed went through so that it can perform actions accordingly. For example, it allows for a smart contract to keep track of local chain assets based on the foreign chain's state.

## How It Works?

### Contract Background

The **ChainSignatures** contract:

- Holds a base public key (`publicKey`), expressed in affine coordinates on the secp256k1 curve.
- Derives new public keys for each `(user, path)` combination by computing an integer `epsilon` (based on a `path` string and user’s address) and performing an EC point addition:

  ```
  DerivedPubKey = BasePubKey + (epsilon × G)
  ```

- Allows a user to request a signature on a 32-byte payload by calling `sign(...)`. A minimal deposit may be required to discourage spam; any unused deposit is refunded once the request is completed.
- Awaits the **MPC network** to compute the actual ECDSA signature offline, then call `respond(...)` with that signature. The contract then emits an event with the signature, and refunds the deposit.
