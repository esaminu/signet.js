# Implementing a Custom Chain Signature Contract

This guide explains how to implement a custom Chain Signature Contract to provide as argument when instantiating a Chain instance.

## Overview

The `ChainSignatureContract` is an abstract class that defines the interface for interacting with the Sig Network infrastructure.

- Key Derivation: Derive the child key from the root key using Sig Network key derivation function
- Sign: Sigs the given payload using Sig Network MPC
- Current Fee: Gets the current signature deposit that handles network congestion
- Root Public Key: Gets the root public key of the Smart Contract on Sig Network MPC

While the library includes a default implementation for the NEAR protocol, you have the flexibility to implement your own contract for other blockchain networks.

## Using the NEAR Implementation

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/code/near/env.ts]
// ---cut---
import { contracts, chainAdapters } from 'signet.js'

const contract = new contracts.near.ChainSignatureContract({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'v1.signer-prod.testnet',
  accountId,
  keypair,
})
```

## Implementing a Custom Chain Signature Contract

To create your own implementation to use on the [Chain Adapter](/primitives/chain-adapter-interface.mdx) Instance, your contract must implement the `BaseChainSignatureContract` interface.

In case you need you want all Sig Network Smart Contract capabilities, you can implement the `ChainSignatureContract` interface.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/contracts/ChainSignatureContract.ts]
```

### Example: NEAR Implementation

Below is the reference implementation for the NEAR, which you can use as a guide for implementing your own chain signature contract:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/contracts/near/ChainSignatureContract.ts]
```
