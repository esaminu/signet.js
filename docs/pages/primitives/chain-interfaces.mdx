# Chain

Chain is the most basic interface of the signet.js library. It provides a standard set of methods that all chains must implement.

With this interface you will be able to interact with Sig Network smart contracts in a standard way to:

- getBalance
- deriveAddressAndPublicKey
- serializeTransaction
- deserializeTransaction
- prepareTransactionForSigning
- finalizeTransactionSigning
- broadcastTx

If you wanna have a look this is the chain interface with a brief description of each method:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/chains/Chain.ts]
```

# Implementing a New Chain

This guide explains how to implement support for a new blockchain network in the signet.js library.

## Overview

To add support for a new blockchain, you need to implement the `Chain` interface:

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create the Chain Types

First, define the transaction types for your chain:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/chains/EVM/types.ts]
```

### 2. Implement the Chain Interface

Create a new class that implements the `Chain` interface:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/chains/EVM/EVM.ts]
```
